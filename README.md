## Alternative plugin managers

[fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) and [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) are also supported. However, I prefer fisher. See [How does Fisher compare to Oh My Fish and Fundle?](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/issues/481) for more.
